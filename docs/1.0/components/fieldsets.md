## Introduction

This needs introducing...

## Fieldsets and legends

Use fieldsets to group related form controls. The first element inside a fieldset must be a legend element which describes the group.

Any general text which is important for filling in the form and cannot be put into a hint, should be in that legend (as shown in the checkbox example). But the legend shouldn't be too long either.

{% highlight html linenos %}

<div class="fieldset">
	...
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

or you can use:

{% highlight html linenos %}

<fieldset>
	...
</fieldset>
{% endhighlight %}
