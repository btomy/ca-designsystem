## Component type

- Generic

## Installation

## Implementation

We make use of [Normalize.css]() to bring each browser into line with one another and reset our styles to a base set of styles.

> If you're using the `cads-support` package, you don't need to do anything to bring this package into your application, it's already a dependency.
