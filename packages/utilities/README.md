## Introduction

This is a meta package that contains all utility packages.

Utility classes adhere to the "Single Responsibility Principle" theory that states that every module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

> For more documentation on a specific utility class, please refer to it's package `README.md`.
