# About the design system

The Citizens Advice design system aims to help create consistent user-centred digital services and products.

This is achieved by following these principles:

### Accessible

Ensuring our products give every user the same benefits regardless of ability.

### Responsive

We design mobile first to make sure Citizens Advice products work regardless of a user's device.

### Performant

Code is written with performance in mind so all users can have a efficient digital experience.

### Scalable

The CSS framework can cater to any size of project.

Utility CSS classes can be mixed and matched together to create consistent UI elements and layout.

Components are tested UI patterns that can be reused independently across digital products.

## Getting started

You can get started by [installing the frontend framework](installation) or using the [Figma library](figma-library).
